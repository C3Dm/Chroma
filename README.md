# Chroma Software 

*Project Overview:*
Chroma is a user interface design to allow the application of user-generated script on GCode. The main idea is to take in GCode 
generated by any sort of 3D-slicer available and have a corresponding script that will strip the code into a general format. Using this general format and
applying Chromatic3D's knowledge of the print material, corresponding scripts will be used to generate a printable GCode for different printer system.

Description of UI: The UI itself is based on the python graphics package KIVY (https://kivy.org) and uses Python 3.x. Since KIVY is a cross-platform tool it is 
possible for us to compile Chroma in different O.S but for now we are only working with Window OS. To compile for Window we will be using PyInstaller, and 
below are the instruction on how to compile the code:
